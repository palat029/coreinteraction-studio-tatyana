				The core of what we do is fairly simple: We hire smart and talented people and give them resources, support, and data so that they can make far-reaching and impactful work. We believe that the future of content is wide open, and that this future will be formed out of experimentation, learning, and play. We will need many people working on this problem from diverse perspectives and using a variety of approaches, and this means that whenever possible we will lean into autonomy with purpose rather than the old model of command-and-control style management. We will figure it out together. It is an exciting, challenging, and sometimes frightening process, and I am so grateful to have all of you as collaborators as we move into the unknown.
