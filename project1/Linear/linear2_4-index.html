    	 A billion views in a month is an amazing accomplishment, but we are just at the beginning of building a giant global media company and there are many challenges ahead. Other publishers are adopting the formats that we pioneered, which means we cannot rest on our past successes. We have to make sure that we are constantly building and improving on what we have learned, as well as challenging ourselves to think of new expressions of the moving image. As new platforms and new technologies come online that change the way that media is consumed, we will have to stay open to new ways of thinking about making content, new skill sets, and new approaches to measuring the value of our work. Our growth will give us opportunities to expand into a wider variety of formats and content businesses, some of which operate on models that no longer reflect the modern reality. As we expand, we always have to lean into new ways of thinking about talent, distribution, and the creative process. We should think about the impact that our media is having on our culture, and, perhaps more importantly, the impact we aspire to have on the world.
