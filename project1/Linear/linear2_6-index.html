		<div class="box-fP">Jonah has talked a lot about how we are able to do amazing things when we bring to bear all of the capacities of BuzzFeed in the service of a single goal. BFMPs growth was possible because of you - all of you. Editorial has given us countless ideas, and perhaps more importantly a road map for how to think about ideation, creative leadership, and iteration. Product, Dev, and Data have created the tools that we now use to try to understand the complexities of experimenting across many platforms and portals. Creative, Operations, and Sales have paved the way for us to engage brands in a way that is changing the conversation about what advertising can aspire to. Design, HR, IT, Events, Marketing... the list goes on - every part of the company has played a role in getting us to this point.
